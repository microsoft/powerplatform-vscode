# Active Context - Current Project State

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank System Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Initial Memory Bank structure created
**Date**: September 25, 2025

**What Was Accomplished**:
- Created complete Memory Bank directory structure
- Implemented all 6 core Memory Bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document defining project scope
  - `productContext.md` - User problems and solutions provided
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development environment
  - `activeContext.md` - This file tracking current state
  - `progress.md` - Project status and completion tracking

**Memory Bank Purpose**:
The Memory Bank serves as persistent knowledge system, essential because memory resets completely between sessions. These files must be read at the start of every task to understand project context and continue work effectively.

## Current Project Understanding

### Power Platform Extension Overview
This is a comprehensive VSCode extension for Power Platform development, serving as the primary IDE integration for:
- **Power Platform CLI integration** with automatic installation/updates
- **Power Pages development** with local workflows and real-time preview
- **PCF component debugging** with full browser automation
- **Solution management** for Dataverse environments
- **AI-powered assistance** through Copilot integration

### Key Architecture Insights
- **Multi-target deployment**: Both desktop (Node.js) and web (browser) environments
- **Service-oriented design**: Authentication, CLI, language servers as separate services
- **Event-driven updates**: Organization changes trigger context updates across services
- **Feature flag system**: ECS integration for gradual rollout and A/B testing
- **Language Server Protocol**: Custom HTML/YAML servers for Power Pages development

## Recent Changes & Insights

### Documentation Structure
The Memory Bank follows a hierarchical information architecture:
```
projectbrief.md → {productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md}
                ↓
            activeContext.md
                ↓
            progress.md
```

Each file builds upon the foundation established in `projectbrief.md`, with `activeContext.md` serving as the current state tracker and `progress.md` maintaining the completion status.

### Project Patterns Identified
1. **Extension Host Pattern**: Single entry point (`src/client/extension.ts`) managing all service lifecycles
2. **Context Propagation**: Authentication changes flow through Artemis → PAC → ECS → UI updates
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Extension provides limited functionality when dependencies unavailable
4. **Security-First Design**: Token management, input validation, and privacy-compliant telemetry

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Memory Bank Design Decisions
- **Markdown Format**: Ensures readability and version control compatibility
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Information flows from general to specific
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Captures both technical and product context
- **Maintenance Strategy**: Regular updates when significant changes occur

### Project Development Patterns
- **TypeScript-First**: Strong typing throughout the codebase
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Desktop and web with feature parity where possible
- **Telemetry Integration**: Privacy-compliant analytics with geographic routing
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and web-specific test coverage

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Memory Bank Maintenance**: Update files when significant changes occur
2. **Project Documentation**: Ensure Memory Bank stays current with development
3. **Context Awareness**: Use Memory Bank for all future task planning

### Development Guidelines
- Always read all Memory Bank files at session start
- Update Memory Bank when discovering new patterns or making significant changes
- Use Memory Bank to guide architectural decisions and maintain consistency
- Keep `activeContext.md` current with recent work and insights

### Important Patterns to Remember
- **Authentication Flow**: User → VSCode Auth API → Azure AD → CLI Context
- **Organization Updates**: Trigger cascading service reinitializations
- **Feature Flags**: ECS controls which capabilities are available
- **Multi-Cloud**: Different authentication endpoints for government clouds

## Project Insights & Learnings

### Extension Development Best Practices
- **Activation Events**: Carefully control when extension activates to minimize resource usage
- **Disposable Pattern**: Always properly clean up resources to prevent memory leaks
- **Lazy Loading**: Initialize services only when needed to improve startup performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of failures with user-friendly error messages

### Power Platform Integration Insights
- **CLI Centricity**: Power Platform CLI is the primary integration point for all services
- **Environment Awareness**: Extension behavior changes based on connected environment
- **Version Management**: Automatic CLI updates ensure compatibility with latest features
- **Telemetry Importance**: Geographic routing and privacy compliance are critical

### Development Workflow Optimization
- **Multi-Target Building**: Webpack configurations for both Node.js and browser environments
- **Language Server Benefits**: Dedicated servers provide rich editing experiences
- **Debugging Capabilities**: Puppeteer integration enables full PCF debugging experience
- **Feature Experimentation**: ECS feature flags allow safe rollout of new capabilities

## Current State Summary
The Memory Bank system is now fully operational and contains comprehensive understanding of the Power Platform VSCode extension project. All core files are created and populated with essential project knowledge that will enable effective continuation of work across memory resets.

The project represents a mature, well-architected VSCode extension that successfully bridges traditional development workflows with Power Platform services, providing a professional development experience for Power Platform developers.
