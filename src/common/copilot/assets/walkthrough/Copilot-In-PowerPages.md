# ![Copilot Screen](./images/M365.svg) Copilot in Power Pages

Copilot in Visual Studio Code helps you code using natural language chat interaction. In Power Pages, you work with site code that includes HTML, JS, or CSS code to make site customizations that are not currently supported in Power Pages low-code design studio. This Copilot chat experience assists Power Pages developers like you to write code by simply describing your expected code behavior using natural language. You can then refine the generated code and use it when customizing your site.

## How to use Copilot to generate code

Copilot in Visual Studio Code is tuned to generate code for Power Pages sites, so its functionalities are limited to Power Pages site supported languages like HTML, JS, and CSS. The generated code from Copilot makes use of supported frameworks like bootstrap and jQuery.

1. In the Copilot chat, describe the code behavior you want using natural language. For example, code for form validation or Ajax calls using the Power Pages Web API.
1. Continue to repharse your questions in the Copilot chat and iterate them till you‚Äôve got what you need.  
1. Once you are happy with the generated code, you can easily copy and paste the code snippet or insert the code to Power Pages site and modify the code further.
1. Use the **up/down** arrow key to navigate between recently entered prompts.

Examples

- `Write code for Web API to fetch active contacts`
- `Write code in JavaScript to make sure that submitted value for phone number field is in valid format`

Note

- Copilot generated code might not have the correct names for tables or columns, so it‚Äôs recommended to verify these details before using the code.
- To generate more accurate code, it is recommended that you open the file where you want to use the code. For example, open a web template for web API or open custom JavaScript file for forms where you want to add field validation.
