This file demonstrates the expected behavior after the login button fix.
Since we can't run VS Code in this environment, this describes what users will see.

# Expected User Experience After Fix

## Before the Fix:
- User clicks "Login" button in Power Pages Actions
- ❌ Nothing happens - no feedback whatsoever
- User is confused and may click multiple times
- No indication if authentication succeeded or failed

## After the Fix:

### Success Scenario:
1. User clicks "Login" button in Power Pages Actions
2. Authentication dialog appears (VS Code's built-in authentication)
3. User completes authentication
4. ✅ **Success message appears**: "Authentication completed successfully."
5. Power Pages Actions tree refreshes with user's environments and sites

### Error Scenarios:
1. User clicks "Login" button
2. If authentication fails:
   - ❌ **Clear error message appears** with specific details:
     - "Authentication failed: Organization URL is missing."
     - "Authentication failed: No authentication results returned."
     - "Authentication failed: Unable to create authentication profile."
     - "Authentication failed: [specific error message]"
3. User understands what went wrong and can take appropriate action

### Key Improvements:
- **Immediate feedback** - User always knows something happened
- **Clear error messages** - Specific guidance on what went wrong
- **Success confirmation** - User knows when authentication worked
- **Professional UX** - No more silent failures or confusion

The login button now provides the professional, responsive experience users expect from VS Code extensions.
